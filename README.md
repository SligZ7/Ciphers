# Ciphers
Provides the ability to quickly and easily encipher or decipher text (most need a keyword) with the cipher of the user's choosing.

## Uses
- Node( for installing react and react bootstrap)

- React

- React Bootstrap

## Design (In-Progress)

### Caesar Shift Functions
~~- Retrieve user input~~

~~- Shift to specifications~~

~~- Get all shifts~~

~~- Display shift or shifts.~~

~~- Limit input for how to shift!!!~~

~~- Display shifts as text is given.~~

### Monoalphabetic Functions
- Retrieve user input

- Ask for keyword (works same for both encrypting and decrypting)

- Replace given text with new alphabet constructed from keyword

###### Extra (Provide tools to assist cryptanalysis)
- letter frequency

- graph showing frequency of the next letter after itself

- digraph and trigraph frequency

- on the fly letter replacement to see changes


### Vigenere Functions
- Retrieve user input

- Ask for keyword (works same for both encrypting and decrypting)

- Replace given text with the different alphabets constructed from  the keyword

###### Extra (Provide tools to assist cryptanalysis)
- counting the repetitions of letter sequences and spaces between them

- provide possible lengths of keyword based on repetitions

- provide letter distributions based on suspected length of keyword

- on the fly letter replacement to see changes

### Playfair Functions
- Retrieve user input

- Ask for keyword (works same for both encrypting and decrypting)

- Replace given text with the box constructed from  the keyword

###### Extra (Provide tools to assist cryptanalysis)
- letter frequency

- digraph and trigraph frequency

- provide working box with ease to move letters around

- on the fly letter replacement to see changes
