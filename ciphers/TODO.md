## TO DO

### Caesar Shift Functions
~~- Retrieve user input~~

~~- Shift to specifications~~

~~- Get all shifts~~

~~- Display shift or shifts.~~

~~- Limit input for how to shift!!!~~

~~- Display shifts as text is given.~~

### Monoalphabetic Functions
~~- Retrieve user input~~

~~- Ask for keyword (works same for both encrypting and decrypting)~~

~~- Replace given text with new alphabet constructed from keyword~~

###### Extra (Provide tools to assist cryptanalysis)
~~- letter frequency~~

- graph showing frequency of the next letter after itself

~~- digraph and trigraph frequency~~

- on the fly letter replacement to see changes


### Vigenere Functions
~~- Retrieve user input~~

~~- Ask for keyword~~

~~- Add button to toggle encrypting and decrypting~~

~~- Replace given text with the different alphabets constructed from  the keyword~~ ~~(Also go backwards to decrypt)~~


###### Extra (Provide tools to assist cryptanalysis)
- counting the repetitions of letter sequences and spaces between them

- provide possible lengths of keyword based on repetitions

- provide letter distributions based on suspected length of keyword

- on the fly letter replacement to see changes

### Playfair Functions
~~- Retrieve user input~~

~~- Ask for keyword (works same for both encrypting and decrypting(go backwards when decrypting, but square is the same))~~

~~- Replace given text with the box constructed from  the keyword~~

- Give user option on which character to replace with what (may need to do more work for reformatting)

###### Extra (Provide tools to assist cryptanalysis)
- provide working box with ease to move letters around

- on the fly letter replacement to see changes

### Other Issues
- Rework buttons to switch modes

~~- Separate components into smaller components~~

- Improve overall code quality (In Progress)
